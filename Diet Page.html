                <h2>Labrador Retriever</h2>
                <img src="labrador-retriever-dog-breed-info (1).jpg">
                <p>1)Labrador puppy age(0-3 months) –  If you are buying or adopting your puppy from a good and responsible breeder, it is highly unlikely that he/she will allow you to take the puppy away from his/her mother before 1.5 months age. However, if this is not the case for your pupper, no need to worry. Although your pup won’t get mother’s milk, you can feed him dog milk available in the market. Be sure not to feed normal cerelac or cow milk as that will result in loose motion as well as stunted growth. Among baby dog milk, there are various options from well-known brands like Royal Canin, Drools, Farmina although I personally prefer Beaphar Lactol or Royal Canin Babydog milk.At this tender age, you need to feed your lab pup via feeding bottle like you would feed a human baby of age 2 months.<br>
                    <br>
                    Milk is the only food apart from purified water which your dog is gonna need till 1.5months. After this age, till 3 months you have two options. You can either continue with milk or look at starter food options like Royal Canin Maxi starter, Drools starter, Farmina Puppy Starter, Canine Creek Starter, Orijen puppy and plenty of other brands which are available in the market. The kibble for starter food is small and most probably, your puppy will be able to chew it. In case he/she is not, consider adding the dry food into a blender with lukewarm water and make a mix which should be dilute enough to be administered by feeding bottle. Certain dry food can be extremely hard to chew, so depending on the toughness of the kibble you might have to break i.e – blend the food yourself as your puppy might not develop good teeth at this age. Puppies of age 1.5 – 3 months should be given around 200g-300g(total) of feed divided in separate meals in a whole day. You should be following this diet of starter food till 3 months age at least. Also, make sure you are vaccinating as well as deworming your pup at the right intervals.<br>
                    <br>
                    2)Labrador puppy age(3-15 months)– Your puppy will grow to the maximum extent in this age span. So, a proper nutritious diet is essential to achieve good growth. You can either go for Royal Canin Maxi Junior or Royal Canin Labrador Junior or puppy variants of other brands like drools, canine creek, Orijen Puppy and Junior(Recommended), Acana large breed puppy, pedigree(not recommended) at this age. If you are giving a good diet like Royal Canin, farmina or even home-made food, growth should be good. For those who can extend their budget, you can go for something even more premium like Acana, Orijen, Arden Grange and the likes. No need to add additional supplements. If you are feeding home-made food like boiled chicken which itself is a very good food option, consider adding some fish oils like Beaphar Salmon Oil. In case, you are going for filler-prone options like pedigree / drools, supplements like Bone builder / Kalk tabs will be useful. Puppies of age 3-6+ months should be given around 300g-450+g of dry food per day.</p>
                

                3)Labrador dog age(15 months onward)– Your puppy is an adult dog now. It’s highly unlikely your dog will grow further in length and height after this age. However, a good diet is recommended to ensure a good life span(above 12 years) and muscle development. For those who want Royal Canin, you can go for Royal Canin Labrador adult. You can also go for more premium brands than Royal canin like Farmina N&D, Hill’s, Orijen, Acana and more. Homemade food can be a healthy option as well. Remember, lab is a high energy dog, so regular exercises/walks are very essential.

Feeding guide(amount to feed in grams) depends on dog weight and varies from brand to brand. You will find the recommended portion for your brand based on the calories it carries on the packet you will buy.

                <h2>Bull Dog</h2>
                <img src="images (6).jpeg">
                
            <p>Our top suggestions for getting your bulldog enough exercise are:<br>
                <br>
                Walking: All dogs, regardless of breed, enjoy exploring their surroundings. Taking a daily walk will scratch their itch of exploring their surroundings, stimulate the dogs’ minds, and get them the exercise they need. Your walks should be long enough to get your bulldog’s heart rate up, let them explore the area, and not be too rigorous. 30-40 minutes is ideal at any one time.<br>
                <br>
                Tug-of-war: As a species, bulldogs have a powerful jaw and bite, making a game such as a tug-of-war an ideal way to get your dog some exercise.
                <br>
                Wrestling: Dogs of all types use wrestling and play as a way to create social bonds with others, establish hierarchies, stimulate their minds, and learn what is socially acceptable behavior with each other.<br>
                <br>
                Getting down on your bulldog’s level and wrestling with them is a fun way for you both to bond and get them the exercise that they need.
                <br>
                Visit the dog park: As we mentioned, wrestling and jumping around with other dogs is a way for your bulldog to learn socialization and expend some energy as well. Let your pup run wild until they get tired and head home. The total duration of time spent running around with other dogs should be based on your bulldog’s biological age and overall health and should not exceed more than one hour.<br>
                <br>
                
                Fetch: The key to playing fetch with a bulldog is to be sure not to throw the toy or ball too far. At first, your bulldog will burst with energy to chase the toy, but as bulldogs are anaerobic animals, they’ll burn out too quickly. In order to get sustained exercise, it’s better to toss the ball not too far away and have your pet do shorter bursts of activity.</p><br>
